The workflow is very similar to our first session:\n","- Each group plans an experiment.\n","- You get one or more eye-tracking devices. Again, they are all different. We will assign them to you based on the needs of your experiment.\n","- Familiarize yourselves with the device and its software. Make sure you know how to export / access the raw data. Some are more complex than others.\n","- Perform a recording.\n","- Record your fellow students and explain your device to them.\n","- Analyze the data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KALAJ9anyNoS"},"source":["#Task 1: Design your experiment\n","You are completely free in what you want to record. Some inspirational thoughts and things to consider:\n","\n","- When choosing your experiment, make sure it is one that you need a mobile eye-tracker for (versus chould be done with a remote eye-tracker as well)\n","- Make the experiment relatively short (max 5 min) so many of us can participate\n","- Think in advance about how you plan to analyze your data! This is the most important criteria by which we will distribute eye-trackers to groups.\n","- Some software supports the use of AR-Markers (such as April tags or Aruco markers)\n","- We can learn most about the devices by pushing their limits (but not their physial durability!)\n","- We do have a driving simulator, table tennis set, kitchen, ... around.\n","- It's worth trying your device both indoors and outdoors.\n","- How do the devices work in combination with eyeglasses?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2UxApHxswQfi"},"source":["##Task 2: Getting to know your device\n","**No matter which device you get - it is incredibly expensive! Handle it with utmost care. Do ask questions. Do not apply force (unless told to do so). Do not sit on the device (nor place it somewhere people might want to sit on)!**\n","\n","\n","That being said:\n","Assemble the device and its recording hardware and install / start the required software.\n","\n","- Tobii Glasses 2: The mobile phone has a Tobii App (or you install it on your own mobile). You need a Laptop with the Tobii Analyzer Software license to process the data after recording.\n","- Tobii Glasses 1: You need a Laptop with Tobii Studio installed.\n","- PupilLabs Core: You need a Laptop with Pupil Capture installed.\n","- PupilLabs Invisible: The mobile phone has the Pupil Companion App installed. You need a Laptop with the PupilLabs software for later analysis.\n","- Look!: You need a Laptop with the Look! software installed.\n","- Dikablis 2: You need a Laptop with D-Lab installed and the USB license dongle."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hvS49lghzWKT"},"source":["##Task 3: Calibrate and measure\n","Go for it and calibrate the device. Record a test with yourselves to make sure you understood how to use your device and that it works."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C6Wt0mcrzxSL"},"source":["#Task 4: Teach the other groups\n","Teach the other groups and record their data while performing your experiment. As with the desktop eye-tracker session, it is less important to have a lot of data recorded. Don't rush things. Instead, you are supposed to learn while using the device as well as teach your fellow students. Ask them questions. It's ok if you/they don't know the answers. Explain what you are doing and why. Think about what you want to explain about your device. What makes your device stand out? Would you recommend using it and why? What software options do you have that might be interesting to explain?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"V5MlBNh20rtk"},"source":["#Task 5: Data analysis\n","All eye-trackers offer some kind of data analysis. Sometimes very limited, sometimes quite complex. Prepare a short analysis of your recordings with the means provided by the used software. That might mean watching the recorded videos and counting gazes towards targets by hand. It might also include the use of AR markers to do so automatically. Feel free to use your knowledge on how to parse eye-tracking data in python if you feel like it.\n","\n","Prepare a short slideshow presentation (max 5 minutes per group) of your experiment and results.\n","We will have a wrap-up at the end of the day where every group can present their experiment and results."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
