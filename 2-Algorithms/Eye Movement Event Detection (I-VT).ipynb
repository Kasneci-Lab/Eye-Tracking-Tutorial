This dataframe is extracted from Tobii Pro Lab, it also has its classifications of fixations and saccades. You can compare between the implemented fixation and saccade classification and the classifications provided by Tobii Pro Lab. Note: The results may differ from those produced by Tobii Pro Lab due to variations in threshold settings and other filtering techniques. To align the outputs more closely, consider implementing additional filtering methods according to your specific needs. For example, you could exclude fixations that are too short in duration."],"metadata":{"id":"gD6CDvtjDYvD"}}]}
