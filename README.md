# Welcome to the Tutorial Repository!

This repository contains three primary folders designed to help you navigate through different aspects of Python programming and specific algorithms related to eye-tracking tutorial.

## 1. Python Tutorials:

For beginners in Python, start here. This section includes:
- Examples of how to run Python code.
- Instructions for installing required applications.
- Basic exercises to familiarize yourself with Python and commonly used libraries.

## 2. Algorithms:

Referenced in the "Eye Tracking Tutorial" paper, this section provides a collection of algorithms. To work with these algorithms:
- Find the required datasets in the 'Data' folder.
- It's crucial to place the data files in the same folder as your algorithm code for them to run correctly. Please ensure you move the required data files from the 'Data' folder to the directory/folder where your code resides.

## 3.Data:
In the data folder, there are data folders which are used with algorithms code. 

## Getting Started:

To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the desired sections as per your needs.
